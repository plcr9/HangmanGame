# HangmanGame

## Introduction

This is a clone of the well-known Hangman game. Each player must guess the letters that make up the mystery word. Every time a letter is guessed that is not featured in the word, the player loses a life. When a player has had six incorrect attempts to guess each letter in the word, the game is over. Alternatively, if each letter in the word is guessed before these six incorrect attempts, the word has been successfully completed and the player has won the game!

### Background to the app

The app is built using Python 3.10. The words used for each game are stored in a separate Python file (hangman_words.py) and are selected at random.

### To Run

Clone the repo: git clone `https://github.com/plcr9/HangmanGame.git`

### Run Hangman App locally
